An action describes how you want to change the state, so to change the state we need to dispatch an action.
An action is used to change the state.

A reducer is a function that takes in the state and an action, and returns the new state. 

So, the redux store, it's an object that's immutable, you can't change it, it's read only. 
So, in order to chang it you need to have a new object and that's the job of the reducer. So, it changes the store
to give us the new state.
